Assignment 7: Simple Code Generator

Makefile
===================================================================
There is a simple makefile included that will compile all the Java
programs needed in the package.
To use, simply enter 'make' or 'make all'.



Driver Details
===================================================================
The driver 'Sc.java' is run by a shell script called 'sc'.
The shell script 'sc' simply takes all command line arguments
passed to it from bash and feeds it to my Java driver.

Driver Usage:
./sc [-s | -c | -t | -a | -i] [-g] [optional_filename]

If no command line arguments are given, the code generator will run.
If no filename is given, the driver prompts for input from stdin.
-s runs the Scanner
-c runs the Concrete Syntax Tree generator
-t runs the Symbol Table generator
-a runs the Abstract Syntax Tree generator 
-i runs the Interpreter
-g adds graphical output to the compiler functions above
   (must be used with -c, -t, or -a)




Compiler Details
===================================================================
Currently, creating the parse tree with -c functions 100% correctly
with both the textual as well as graphical output via -g. 

The symbol table also functions 100% correctly via the -t function,
however the textual and graphical output of the symbol table does
not work correctly according to the assignment 4 instructions.
Instead, the -t option creates the symbol table and outputs my own
version of textual output that I've implemented via a returnST()
method inside Parser.java. This is all for my own testing purposes 
to verify that the functionality of the syntax table is correct.

The abstract syntax tree is fully functional now, however the
graphical/textual output has not been fully implemented. Currently
the AST's functionality is verified through a "simpler" version
of the textual output required by the assignment. At a glance, this
simpler output should be able to verify that all the instructions
are properly built inside the AST.

The interpreter is not fully functional currently.

The driver is currently able to fully handle the code generator.
However, the code generator itself is not working. 
If no command line options are given, the code generator will:
1) Run and take input from stdin
2) Output the generated code to stdout.
If a filename is given:
1) the code generator will run and take input from the file
2) output the generated code to another file with the same basename 
   as the input filename, but with a ".s" extension
   (as described in the assignment directions).
